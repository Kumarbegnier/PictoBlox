**To implement a "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game using PictoBlox. Here's a basic outline of how you can do that:**

Setup: Open PictoBlox and create a new project.

Sprites: Create sprites for rock, paper, and scissors. You can draw them using PictoBlox's sprite editor or import images.

Variables: Create variables to keep track of the player's choice and the computer's choice.

Player Input: Add code so that when the player clicks on a sprite (rock, paper, or scissors), the corresponding choice is stored in the player's choice variable.

Computer Choice: Generate a random number to represent the computer's choice (1 for rock, 2 for paper, 3 for scissors).

Comparison: Compare the player's choice with the computer's choice to determine the winner.

Display Result: Show the result (win, lose, or draw) to the player.

Play Again: Add an option for the player to play again if they want.
